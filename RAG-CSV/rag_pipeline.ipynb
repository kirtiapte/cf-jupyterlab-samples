      "So, the hydraulic system is responsible for both the flaps and the landing gear. The specific mention of Landing Gear B having a hydraulic failure suggests that the landing gear's hydraulic system is prone to leaks. The answer should combine these points. I need to make sure I'm not missing any other equipment mentioned. The context doesn't mention other equipment like engines, so probably only the landing gear and flaps. But the user asked about hydraulic leaks, so the answer is the landing gear's hydraulic system. Wait, the context says \"Hydraulics / Actuation: Hydraulic system controlling flaps and landing gear,\" so both are part of the hydraulic system. But the specific issue mentioned is in the landing gear. So the answer would be the landing gear's hydraulic system. But maybe the user wants both flaps and landing gear. However, the context only explicitly mentions the landing gear having a hydraulic failure. The hydraulics/actuation section says it's for flaps and landing gear. So the answer is the hydraulic system controlling flaps and landing gear, but the specific issue mentioned is landing gear. But the user is asking about equipment that has reported hydraulic leaks. So based on the context, the landing gear's hydraulic system has had issues. But the hydraulics/actuation section mentions both flaps and landing gear. However, the example given is landing gear B. So maybe the answer is the landing gear's hydraulic system. But the user might be looking for both. I need to check the context again.\n",

      "The context says: \"Hydraulics / Actuation: Hydraulic system controlling flaps and landing gear.\" So the hydraulic system for both. But the example given is landing gear B with hydraulic failure. So the answer would be the landing gear's hydraulic system. However, the question is about equipment that has reported issues. Since the hydraulic system controls both, but the specific example is landing gear, maybe the answer is the landing gear's hydraulic system. But the user might want both. But the context doesn't mention flaps having issues, only landing gear. So the answer is the landing gear's hydraulic system. But the hydraulics/actuation section says it's for both. Hmm. The user's question is about equipment with hydraulic leaks. The context says that landing gear B had hydraulic failure, so the answer is the landing gear's hydraulic system. But the hydraulics/actuation is the system that controls both, but the issue is in the landing gear. So the answer should be the landing gear's hydraulic system. But maybe the answer is the hydraulic system in general. But the user is asking for the equipment, which would be the landing gear's hydraulic system. Alternatively, the answer is the landing gear and flaps, but the context only mentions landing gear. So I think the answer is the landing gear's hydraulic system. But the user might want both. However, the context only mentions landing gear B. So I should go with that.\n",

      "Based on the provided context, **landing gear systems** have reported issues with hydraulic leaks. Specifically, **Landing Gear B** is mentioned as experiencing a hydraulic failure, which requires inspecting hydraulic lines and refilling fluid. The hydraulic system controlling both **flaps** and **landing gear** (as noted in \"Hydraulics / Actuation\") is critical for these components, but the explicit example given is the landing gear. \n",
